Load_st_decision file contains the behavior data and neural spiking data, the load_extra file contains more complex neural data such as local field potential and exact spiking time. 

Two of the best modelling process was uploaded

LFP-FC-stimulus file contains neural network modelling process of LFP-Pearson FC harmonic centrality + visual stimulus

Granger causality FC file contains file of modelling process of mean firing rate GC-FC harmonic centrality + visual stimulus

File 'internal state' contains granger causality procedure and output the best processed GC data
